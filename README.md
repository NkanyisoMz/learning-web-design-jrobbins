# Learning Web Design Projects

This repository contains my solutions and practice projects from the book **"Learning Web Design" by Jennifer Robbins (5th Edition)**. 

## About the Book

"Learning Web Design" is a beginner-friendly guide to web development, covering the basics of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and responsive design. It includes hands-on exercises and projects to build practical skills.

## Purpose of the Repository

I created this repository to:
- Store and organize my solutions for the book's projects.
- Track my progress chapter by chapter.
- Use Git and GitHub for version control and project management.
- Showcase my learning journey in web design.

## Structure

The repository is organized by chapter, with each folder containing:
- The project files (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, images, etc.).
- Notes or reflections about what I learned in that chapter.
